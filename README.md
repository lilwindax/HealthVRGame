## Introduction 
Society's lack of understanding of the immediate link between their food consumption,
energy intake, and the associated physical activity necessary to meet the energy expenditure.
A better understanding between the link will have substantial positive health impacts. Our
game intends to create a gameplay link between calories consumed and the effect this has on
the body. In this way, we want to enforce a mental connection that can be transferred to the
real world. The game explores the many factors that influence how a person chooses their
diet, how calories are communicated to the consumer through labelling, as well as the effect
this calorie intake has on the body and mind. The process that communicates calories to the
consumer do not align with the knowledge of the general public, and are thus ineffective.
Intake - Outtake aims to bridge this gap. A combination of gameplay mechanics and in-game
labelling are used to communicate the effects of unhealthy and healthy eating habits.

## Contributing factors to our food choices 
Time scarcity and ease of access affects our food choices/contributing factors to our food
choices. There are a variety of factors contributing to our food choices, these can include time
scarcity, financial capabilities, and upbringing. In the daily life of a working person they
wake up, go to work, and come back to sleep, and within that time they need to fit in meals
such as breakfast and dinner. However, sometimes there may not be enough time to fit all that
in, especially for a really busy person. Some people may feel cooking is well worth their
time, others may feel it is not necessary or worth their time. (Jabs, J., & Devine, C. M., 2006).
In this situation the character is a very busy person with all their daily activities such as
cleaning up the house, going for a walk and other tasks that take up their time and energy.
When a person has spent a lot of their time doing activities and using up all their energy and
with little time left in the day. The character you play has an energy level which is affected by
the time scarcity and choices in food you make, this may end up determining your choices in
dinner as well, if there is not enough energy or time left to create a healthy meal and instead
buy take out. A person's financial capabilities directly affects their ability to buy desirable
foods - as typically healthy, fresh produce is more expensive in supermarkets - or so people
think. In America, for example, a meal at McDonalds can be as low as $2 which is appealing
to the consumer's eye, especially with a tight budget. Funnily enough, if proper research is
undergone, it can be found that buying healthy meals at the supermarket is cheaper. This
proves that although one's budget can affect their food choices, so can the influences of
society and societal norms. Fast food industries can be seen as the downfall of America’s
health. On another note with upbringings and how a standard American family can be seen
buying take out quite often, the children may never learn or be bothered to learn how to cook
foods or what to do when it comes to dinner, lunch or any meals. This causes a lack of
knowledge of food, the person would go for the safest and only option they would know due
to their previous years with their parents, buying take out.

## Physical activity labeling vs Calorie labeling 
When it comes to deciding what to eat, a key factor in guiding our decisions is the food
nutritional labelling. Research by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention have found
the following. Amongst the consumers that classify themselves as weight concession, 81
percent happen to read the nutritional panel. From which they evaluated their decisions (The
Hartman Group, 2016). The nutritional labeling displays information such as the fat, protein,
sugar and calories in the product. A key driver in the nutritional labeling section is the
calories. Calorie labeling has been implemented to guide consumer behaviour, however the
effects of behaviour change has been minimal (Viera et al., 2017). The behaviour change here
is referred to as the awareness and understanding when making food related choices. When a
consumer has to make a decision about their food choices they should be able to understand
the effects of what they are about to consume. A research by the Calorie Control Council
found that out of 1024 people surveyed, only 12% understood the calories they consumed on
a day to day basis (Calorie Control Council, 2015). This clearly proves the fact the having
such sections in the nutritional section of food isn’t as effective as it is assumed to be. An
alternative to calories labeling is physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) labels. Which
instead displays the calories in a symbolised manner by stating the minutes of exercise
needed to burn off the calories (Yang et al., 2021). Using this method of displaying PACE
labeling has proved to be successful in lowering the amount of calories a consumer ordered,
by 65 Kcal (Seyedhamzeh et al., 2018). Using this research, a game element in our game was
developed. With the idea of experimentation, our game gives the player a choice between
various food options. The game deliberately implements different methods of nutritional
labeling, which is split into different scenes. The first method is to display no nutritional
labeling, just price. The object for the player here is to make the decision based on their prior
knowledge. The next method is to provide the player with a nutritional panel with PACE
labeling. This will hopefully allow for behavioural change in the player. Seeing the impact of
the food you are able to consume will affect the decision. The final method is to display a
regular nutritional label, with the calories in Kcals. Through the iteration of these methods,
the aim is to educate the player around the importance of understanding the effect of your
food choices.

## Calorie intake and its effects  
The effects of caloric intake is often not understood by both younger people and adults. For
this reason we wanted to display these effects to the player, as well as the relationship it has
with exercise. The Texas Obesity Research Centre collected information from middle school
students (aged 12-15), and concluded that the students “do not understand that calories are a
measure of the energy content of food” nor the “physical activity...required to expend the
calorie content.” This reflects that the students were not being educated about calorie intake
by either their school or parents. Adults too have this lack of understanding. While BMC
Public Health found that most adults understand caloric needs, “90% underestimated the
calorie content” of unhealthy foods. In this way, many adults’ energy intake is greater than
their energy expenditure. Our game intends to display this relationship between caloric intake
and its effects by transferring them to gameplay elements so they are easier to understand.
The food items are designed to be clearly distinguishable as either healthy or unhealthy. For
example, the lunch options of either a burger or a salad clearly portray the salad as the lower
calorie option. The choices then affect the feedback during gameplay, reflecting the real
world relationship between calorie intake and the body’s function. Specifically, caloric intake
also has an effect on the brain and nervous system. Neuromolecular Med. found that
“prolonged excessive caloric intake impairs neural function.” The report also states that
“neurons in the hippocampus have among the highest energy requirements,” and thus the
cells in the hippocampus are greatly “influenced by energy expenditure and intake.”
Conversely, “increased [energy] expenditure enhances neuronal function.” To reflect this in
our gameplay, we had negative effects for consuming high calorie foods, such as poor
feedback and slower movements when completing tasks, and the opposite effect for the low
calorie options. Additionally, “excessive energy intake leads to deficits in neuroplasticity,”
while the opposite occurs for an energy expenditure. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s
ability to adapt to new experiences, again mimicked in poor/good gameplay feedback. In
terms of exercise, the American Physiological Society states that, an “increase in physical
activity due to exercise has little effect on energy intake,” i.e: energy expenditure does not
affect how the body takes in calories. For this reason, exercise can be an independent means
of having a desirable energy balance, and thus is kept separate from our food mechanics.

## Conclusion 
In summary, there is a clear lack of understanding between the lack of our food intake, energy
content and the physical activity needed to burn it off. Research has proved that our current
ways of dealing with the food calories and the way it is labeled is ineffective. The result of
this is that our lifestyle and health is being greatly impacted. There is a need to come up with
new solutions and ways to better educate and raise awareness about this link. Our game aims
to achieve this with the game elements that have been designed with the research in mind.
Through our gameplay players will start to build a desire from within to get over this
challenge. Eventually, leading to behaviour change with the decisions they make with
deciding what to do, and greater understanding of the link.
