# Intake Outtake - VR Health Game 

## Introduction 
Society's lack of understanding of the immediate link between their food consumption,
energy intake, and the associated physical activity necessary to meet the energy expenditure.
A better understanding between the link will have substantial positive health impacts. Our
game intends to create a gameplay link between calories consumed and the effect this has on
the body. In this way, we want to enforce a mental connection that can be transferred to the
real world. The game explores the many factors that influence how a person chooses their
diet, how calories are communicated to the consumer through labelling, as well as the effect
this calorie intake has on the body and mind. The process that communicates calories to the
consumer do not align with the knowledge of the general public, and are thus ineffective.
Intake - Outtake aims to bridge this gap. A combination of gameplay mechanics and in-game
labelling are used to communicate the effects of unhealthy and healthy eating habits.
